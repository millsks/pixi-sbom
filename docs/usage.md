# Using `pixi sbom`

`pixi-sbom` is a [pixi extension](https://pixi.sh/latest/integration/extensions/introduction/): a standalone
executable named `pixi-sbom`. Pixi finds any `pixi-<name>` binary on `PATH` (or in its own global bin directory) and
runs it when you type `pixi <name>`. There is no plugin registration; installing the binary is the whole setup.

## Installing

| Method | Command |
|---|---|
| pixi global (recommended) | `pixi global install pixi-sbom` |
| Prebuilt binary | Download `pixi-sbom-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz` (or `.zip` on Windows) from the [releases page](https://github.com/millsks/pixi-sbom/releases), verify the `.sha256` next to it, and put `pixi-sbom` on your `PATH` |
| From source | `pixi run build` in a clone, then copy `target/release/pixi-sbom` to `~/.pixi/bin/` |

Check it is picked up:

```sh
pixi --list          # ...  sbom  (via pixi-sbom)
pixi sbom --version
```

`pixi-sbom --help` and `pixi sbom --help` are equivalent; the binary can be run directly without pixi.

## Running

The command reads a `pixi.lock`, picks one environment and one platform from it, and writes one JSON document.

```sh
pixi sbom
```

With no options this means:

1. Find `pixi.lock` by searching the current directory, then each parent, until one is found (the same walk pixi
   itself does for its manifest).
2. Describe the `default` environment on the platform the command is running on (for example `osx-arm64`).
3. Write CycloneDX 1.6 JSON (`--spec-version 1.7` for 1.7) to `sbom.cdx.json` in the directory that contains the
   lockfile.

### Options

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--lockfile <PATH>` | upward search from cwd | Lockfile to read. The file must exist; there is no fallback search when this is given. |
| `--format <cyclonedx\|spdx>` | `cyclonedx` | `cyclonedx` writes CycloneDX JSON; `spdx` writes SPDX 2.3 JSON. |
| `--spec-version <1.6\|1.7>` | `1.6` | CycloneDX version to write. `1.7` (ECMA-424 2nd edition) is backward compatible and adds a `citations` entry attributing the inventory to the lockfile; the default stays `1.6` until the common consumers default to 1.7. Only valid with `--format cyclonedx`. |
| `--output <PATH>` | `<lockfile dir>/sbom.cdx.json` or `sbom.spdx.json` | File to write; parent directories are created. `-` writes the document to stdout (logs stay on stderr). With `--all-environments` / `--all-platforms` this is a directory instead, and `-` is rejected. |
| `-e, --environment <NAME>` | `default` | Lock environment to describe. Must exist in the lockfile. |
| `-p, --platform <PLATFORM>` | host platform | Platform within that environment, e.g. `linux-64`, `osx-arm64`, `win-64`. Must be locked for the environment. |
| `--all-environments` | off | Write one document per environment (see below). Cannot be combined with `--environment`. |
| `--all-platforms` | off | Write one document per platform the environment is locked for (see below). Cannot be combined with `--platform`. |
| `--pypi-mapping <lock\|prefix>` | `lock` | Where PyPI identities for conda packages come from. `prefix` downloads the conda-forge mapping (cached for a day) so conda-installed Python packages get a `pkg:pypi` purl. |
| `--pypi-mapping-file <PATH>` | | Offline copy of that mapping; implies the same enrichment with no network. Cannot be combined with `--pypi-mapping`. |
| `--primary-purl <conda\|pypi>` | `conda` | With `pypi`, a conda package that has a PyPI purl uses it as its primary `purl` so vulnerability scanners can match it. |
| `--pypi-licenses` | off | Look up licenses for PyPI packages from the index JSON API (the lockfile records none). Responses are cached; a failed lookup is logged and the run continues. |
| `-v`, `-vv` | info | Raise the log level to debug / trace. Logs go to stderr; the SBOM never goes to stdout. |
| `-q`, `-qq`, `-qqq` | info | Lower it to warnings only / errors only / silent. Error diagnostics are printed regardless. |
| `-h, --help`, `-V, --version` | | Usual meanings. |

`RUST_LOG` is also honored and overrides `-v`/`-q` (for example `RUST_LOG=pixi_sbom::lock=debug`).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PIXI_SBOM_PYPI_URL` | Base of the PyPI JSON API queried by `--pypi-licenses` (default `https://pypi.org/pypi`); point it at a mirror such as devpi or Artifactory. |
| `PIXI_SBOM_CACHE_DIR` | Where downloaded data (the PyPI mapping, PyPI metadata) is cached. Default: `pixi-sbom` under `PIXI_CACHE_DIR` if set, else the platform cache directory (`~/.cache/pixi-sbom`, `~/Library/Caches/pixi-sbom`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pixi-sbom\cache`). |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` | Honored for every download. |
| `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` | Pins the document timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch). With it set, repeated runs over the same lockfile are byte-identical, which lets CI diff SBOMs between commits. See [output-format.md](output-format.md#reproducibility). |
| `RUST_LOG` | Log filter, overrides `-v`/`-q`. |

### Examples

```sh
# SPDX instead of CycloneDX
pixi sbom --format spdx

# CycloneDX 1.7 instead of 1.6
pixi sbom --spec-version 1.7

# Straight into a consumer, nothing written to disk
pixi sbom --output - | grype

# Scannable: give conda-forge Python packages their PyPI identity and make it primary
pixi sbom --pypi-mapping prefix --primary-purl pypi --output - | grype

# The same, air-gapped, from a saved copy of the mapping
pixi sbom --pypi-mapping-file /srv/mirrors/compressed_mapping.json --primary-purl pypi

# Fill in licenses for PyPI wheels from pypi.org
pixi sbom --pypi-licenses

# A specific lockfile and output file, from anywhere
pixi sbom --lockfile ~/proj/pixi.lock --output ~/reports/proj.cdx.json

# The environment you actually ship, for the platform you ship it on
pixi sbom -e prod -p linux-64

# Every environment, each on linux-64, into a directory
pixi sbom --all-environments -p linux-64 --output sboms/

# Every platform the prod environment is locked for
pixi sbom -e prod --all-platforms --output sboms/

# Everything: one document per environment and platform
pixi sbom --all-environments --all-platforms --output sboms/
```

### One document per environment and platform

A pixi lockfile can hold many environments, each locked for several platforms. An SBOM, by contrast, is expected to
describe one deliverable, so `pixi sbom` never merges environments or platforms into one document:

- `--environment` / `--platform` pick exactly one combination.
- `--all-environments` runs that selection once per environment, `default` first, then the rest alphabetically.
- `--all-platforms` runs it once per platform the environment is locked for, alphabetically.
- Both together cover every (environment, platform) pair in the lockfile.

In batch mode `--output` names the directory that receives the files (default: next to the lockfile), and each file is
named after what it describes:

| Flags | File name |
|---|---|
| `--all-environments` | `sbom-<environment>.cdx.json` / `.spdx.json` |
| `--all-platforms` | `sbom-<platform>.cdx.json` |
| both | `sbom-<environment>-<platform>.cdx.json` |

Each document records which environment and platform it describes (`pixi:environment` / `pixi:platform` in the
CycloneDX metadata properties; the root package `sourceInfo` in SPDX), so a batch of files stays self-describing.

## Exit codes and errors

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Document(s) written. |
| 1 | A runtime error; a diagnostic is printed to stderr. |
| 2 | Command-line usage error (unknown option, conflicting options such as `--output -` with `--all-environments` or `--all-platforms`, or `--spec-version` with `--format spdx`). |

Runtime diagnostics carry a stable code you can grep for in CI logs:

| Code | When | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `pixi_sbom::discover::not_found` | No `pixi.lock` in the current directory or any parent | Run `pixi lock` in the workspace, or pass `--lockfile` |
| `pixi_sbom::discover::missing` | `--lockfile` points at a file that does not exist | Check the path |
| `pixi_sbom::lock::parse` | The lockfile is not valid, or is newer than this build understands | Regenerate with `pixi lock`; upgrade `pixi-sbom` if the lockfile `version:` is newer than 7 |
| `pixi_sbom::lock::environment` | `--environment` names something not in the lockfile | The message lists the available environments |
| `pixi_sbom::lock::platform` | The chosen platform is not locked for that environment | The message lists the locked platforms; pass `-p` |
| `pixi_sbom::lock::current_platform` | The host platform could not be detected | Pass `-p` explicitly |
| `pixi_sbom::mapping::fetch` | `--pypi-mapping prefix` could not download the mapping and has no cached copy | Check network/proxy, or pass `--pypi-mapping-file`; a stale cache is used automatically with a warning |
| `pixi_sbom::mapping::read` / `parse` | `--pypi-mapping-file` is unreadable or not a JSON object of conda name to PyPI name | Check the file |
| `pixi_sbom::purl::invalid` | A package name the purl spec cannot encode | Report it with the lockfile entry |
| `pixi_sbom::format::io` / `serialize` | The output could not be written | Check the path and permissions; `--output` must not be an existing directory in single-environment mode |

Missing or unreadable manifests (`pixi.toml` / `pyproject.toml`) are not errors: the workspace name falls back to the
lockfile's directory name and a warning is logged.

## Running in CI

The binary has no runtime dependencies, so any job that can install pixi can produce SBOMs. With GitHub Actions and
[`setup-pixi`](https://github.com/prefix-dev/setup-pixi):

```yaml
- uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
  with:
    run-install: false
- name: Generate SBOMs
  run: |
    pixi global install pixi-sbom
    pixi sbom --all-environments -p linux-64 --output sboms/
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: sboms
    path: sboms/
```

The lockfile is the only input, so this step does not need `pixi install` to have run first, and it works on a
different platform from the one being described (`-p linux-64` on a macOS runner is fine).

## Consuming the output

The documents validate against the official JSON schemas and load in the usual tooling. Examples:

```sh
# Convert between formats or inspect
syft convert sbom.cdx.json -o spdx-json
cyclonedx-cli validate --input-file sbom.cdx.json --input-format json

# Vulnerability scan
grype sbom:sbom.cdx.json
```

Conda packages are identified by `pkg:conda/...` purls with `channel`, `subdir`, `build` and `type` qualifiers; PyPI
packages by `pkg:pypi/...`.

Scanners have no conda vulnerability data, so by default a conda-only Python environment scans as clean no matter
what it contains. To get real results, give conda-forge Python packages their PyPI identity and make it the primary
purl:

```sh
pixi sbom --pypi-mapping prefix --primary-purl pypi --output - | grype
```

`--pypi-mapping prefix` consults the same conda-forge mapping pixi uses (downloaded once a day into a cache);
`--pypi-mapping-file` takes an offline copy. On a typical conda-forge Python environment this gives roughly 60% of the
components a `pkg:pypi` purl. See [output-format.md](output-format.md#pypi-identities-for-conda-packages) for exactly
what is recorded.
